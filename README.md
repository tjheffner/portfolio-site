# portfolio-site
this is the very basic barebones outline of my portfolio-to-be, using angular JS as the base.


#icebox
take out the /#/ in the url routes
port over some projects from old portfolio (linked on home page)
add at least one project that uses a SQL database
add some more information to each project, not just a bare link
